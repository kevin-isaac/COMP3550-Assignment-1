Water, as we know, is an all too necessary commodity to be in possession of, when it comes
to our survival. Humans, animals, plants; all living organisms need water on some timely basis
in order to continue living. As such, it would probably make sense that an abundant supply of
water would be all that we needed to live happily as far as our water consumption goes.
Unfortunately, even if one has all the water in the world (the vast oceans and all), that does
not mean that all our H2O based needs are fulfilled. On the contrary, all the drinking water
in the world can promptly pose a serious problem if it is not SANITARY.
